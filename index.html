<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
<p> I was born in Sinkaliw Malaki, Alfonso, Cavite, Philippines and I moved to America in 2006 when I was around
two and a half years old.  I graduated from Scotia-Glenville High School (cental-ish NY) in 2021 and I am 
currently attending Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) as a first year Software Engineer major.  In my 
free time I like to read random webpages and back at home, I spent a lot of my time building and tinkering 
with my PC setup.  I also spent a lot of my free time driving my car because I like to drive my car.  One of 
my favorite foods is Leche Flan which is a Filipino version of the Spanish Flan De Leche</p>

For providing the inspiration and guidance to create this portfolio.

## Development

### 1. Start hot-reloading development server

```bash
$ npm install                    
// downloads and installs dependencies
$ npm audit fix                  
// fixes security vulnerabilities
$ npm run dev                    
// run development server
```

### 2. Build application for production

```bash
$ npm run build                  
// optimizes and minifies files
```

### 3. Generate static application (E.g. for hosting on https://pages.github.com/)

```bash
$ npm run generate               
// output directory: /docs (for GitHub Pages)
```
